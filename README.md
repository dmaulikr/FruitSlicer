# FruitSlicer

## Overview:

FruitSlicer is a sample project that shows my approach on how to create a Fruit Ninja-like game with Sprite Kit. The project is not completely finished yet and there's obviously a lot of things to add still (background music, additional game modes, handle more realistic slices VS using sprite textures etc..).
